# RDS Northeast SMS Opt-In Information

RDS Northeast sends SMS messages only to employees or contractors who are part of an on-call support rotation.

## How Opt-In Occurs

Employees or contractors opt in to receive SMS messages by voluntarily providing their mobile phone number when they are added to the on-call rotation.

This opt-in occurs through internal company onboarding or assignment processes, where individuals are informed that SMS messages will be used for after-hours operational alerts related to job responsibilities.

Consent is documented internally and is required before any SMS messages are sent.

## Message Details

Messages are operational in nature and may include alerts related to after-hours support requests.

Message frequency varies and messages are sent only when after-hours events occur.

Message and data rates may apply.

## Opt-Out

Recipients may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying STOP.
